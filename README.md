# ⚪ Goban Watcher ⚫

The Goban Watcher is a GitHub repository focused on leveraging Computer Vision technology to simplify the notation of Baduk games.
This project is designed to automate the generation of SGF (Smart Game Format) files by capturing and transcribing Baduk games through advanced Computer Vision algorithms.


### Setup

If you are using a `macos` and you have `pyenv` installed:
```shell
source initialize.sh
```
Following step will be performed:

1. Checks if correct python version is installed.
    1. Install correct version if `pyenv` is installed.
    2. Set it as global python versiion
2. Create `venv`
    1. Activate it
    2. Install all `requirements.txt`
3. Create `.env`

--- 

### Code structure

```shell
.
├── .env
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── initialize.sh
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
├── src
│   └── __init__.py
└── tests
    └── __init__.py
```

- **Functionalities** -> `src`
- **Tests**: -> `tests`
- **Necessary requirements**: `requirements.txt`

--- 

### Guidelines

1. Add new requirements to the `requirements.txt`. 📦
2. Put your code into `src`. `main.py` should be as clean as possible and only serve as the entry point of the application/tool. ✍️
3. Tests are run with `pytest`.
